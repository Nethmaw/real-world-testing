   1. **Registered Users**

      During the sign-in process, registered users are provided seamless access to their accounts upon providing valid credentials. 

   2. **Unregistered Users**

      On the other hand, non-registered users are appropriately restricted from accessing account features and functionalities, requiring them to sign up for an account to access the platform fully.
